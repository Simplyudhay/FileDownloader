Description of the Code

The provided Java application implements a simple TCP-based file transfer system consisting of a client and server component. Here's an overview of the functionalities and structure:
Server Component:
•	The server component is implemented in the TCPServer class.
•	It listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.
•	Upon connection, it assigns a unique connection ID to each client and handles client requests concurrently using multithreading.
•	It allows clients to upload files to the server's working directory and provides a list of available files for download.
Client Component:
•	The client component is implemented in the TCPClient class.
•	It connects to the server using the specified host address and port number.
•	It allows users to upload files to the server and download files from the server's working directory.
•	It displays the list of files available on the server for download and provides a user-friendly interface for file transfer operations.
User Interface:
•	The user interface for both the client and server components is built using Java AWT and Swing, providing a graphical interface for user interaction.
Command Line Configuration:
•	The server and client components support command-line configuration for specifying the working directory, host address, and port number.
File Transfer Protocol:
•	The file transfer protocol utilizes TCP for reliable and ordered delivery of data between client and server, ensuring data integrity during file transfer operations.
